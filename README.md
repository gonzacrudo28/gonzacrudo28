- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gonzacrudo28
- ðŸŒ± I am currently halfway through my Software Engineering degree at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong interest in creating applications, servers, and protocols. With hands-on experience in projects ranging from distributed systems to programming in C and Rust, I am looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world environments and contribute innovative solutions.
