- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gonzacrudo28
- ðŸŒ± I am currently in my 4th year of Software Engineering at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), with plans to graduate in 2026. Throughout my studies, I've gained solid experience in developing applications, servers, and protocols, working on projects ranging from distributed systems to programming in C and Rust. I have a strong passion for continuous learning, collaborating with others, and adapting to diverse technical environments. I'm looking for internship or employment opportunities where I can apply my knowledge and contribute innovative solutions to real-world projects.
